/*[L13 P4] Telephone keypad
Have you ever wondered why they always have alphabet next to the digits on the keys?  Historically, have been used, mainly in the United States, as a technique for remembering telephone numbers easily. For example, an interior decorator might license the telephone number 1-800-724-683-7, but advertise it as the more memorable phone word 1-800-PAINTER. Notice how there's an hyphen after every 3 digits.
Question) How?
Ans) When you type PAINTER you will actually end up typing on the keys 724-683-7
Write a program, which accepts a code word of the format "1-800-H0LIDAY‚Äù and converts that into the original phone number.
Example 1:
Input:
1-800-H0LIDAY
Output:
1-800-465-432-9
Example 2:
Input:
1-800-BHANUPIZZA
Output:
1-800-242-687-499-2
Hint: 
1) Ignore the 1-800-part and focus on the alphabetic string part.
2) For every character figure out the digit of the key it belongs to.
    To achieve this, create an arrays with strings {"ABC", "DEF" ..  "WXYZ"}
    For every character check the index of the string that it is a member of.
Constraints:
Always assume the strings are uppercase.
Always assume the strings are not longer than 20 characters.
